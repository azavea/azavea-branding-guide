Our blog is one vehicle for sharing what we do with the world.

Our posts cover a wide variety of topics, all within the realm of open source, open data, and geospatial technology. We aim to share examples, guides, and resources so that others can learn from our successes (and mistakes).

We encourage our team members to follow our [blog guidelines](https://github.com/azavea/azavea-blog) when writing for our website. These guidelines include instructions for writing, editing, publishing, and sharing blog posts.
