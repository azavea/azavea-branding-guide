description: We use topographic patterns to highlight our work in geospatial.

---
Subtle background patterns in combination with our color scheme help us subtly indicate our companyâ€™s focus on geospatial work. While there is a collection of topographic patterns that we specifically use at the moment, they are only highlighted here to give access and are not meant to be prescription or all encompassing of how Azavea uses pattern.
