Azavea manages two fellowship programs for 12 weeks each summer. Communicating the nuances of each program is important so that we can effectively recruit strong candidates, mentors, nonprofit partners, and sponsors.

## Azavea Open Source Fellowship
Always capitalize the first letter of each word in “Azavea Open Source Fellowship”. It should never be written in upper camel case. View the [Azavea Open Source Fellowship website](https://fellowship.azavea.com/) for more information about the program.

### Elevator pitch
This is a generalized description of the Azavea Open Source Fellowship program and can stand alone in communications.

{% include copy-paste.html
  description = "The Azavea Open Source Fellowship Program is a 12-week professional training fellowship that matches software engineering fellows with open source projects at Azavea."
%}

### Tagline
The tagline should either be used in combination with the program name or with the elevator pitch. This ensures brand association with the shortened description.
