We are excited to release this first version of the Azavea Branding Guidelines and Resources website! We expect that the guide will be a continual work-in-progress, and invite you to help us make this useful for you, our fellow Azaveans.

## What is in this release
As of launch, there are three primary sections (Identity, Communication, and Design) and a Resources page. 

### Identity 
Here you will find official ways to communicate about Azavea and our products, if you ever should need/want to reference them. The Identity section offers information about Azavea as a company, as well as soundbites for the company mission and each of our products and fellowships. It’s also a good place to reference the status and spelling of our products, partnerships, and fellowships.

This can be helpful if you are communicating with the press, talking with a prospective hire at a networking event, or looking to include more information about the company in a blog post.

### Communication
The Communication section is largely a light content style guide. It includes template suggestions for email signatures and some loose guidelines for how to contribute to the Azavea blog and social media accounts.

### Design
This section curates existing marketing design information and assets in order to make them more easily accessible. It is largely based upon the branding guide on the fileshare, and simply makes this information more easily accessible. 

The grayscale colors are a new addition, however, and should hopefully be helpful for developing Azavea-branded assets so that they have a cohesive color scheme.

### Resources
The resources page is a catch-all for tools that folks within the office use to complete everyday tasks. You may notice that it’s pretty bare right now—this is a section that would especially benefit from outside input!

## Page badges
You might see an “In Progress” badge on some pages. These badges indicate that a page has content that is currently being reviewed by relevant Azavea team members. If a page has an “In Progress” badge, you should touch base with marketing staff before using content publicly.

## Intentions for future releases
We plan to announce updates to the branding guide when there is a big change, such as an entirely new page, a new collection of assets, or edits to standard marketing copy.
