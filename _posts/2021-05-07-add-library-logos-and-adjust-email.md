## Products & Tools
This page has been renamed from "Products" to "Products & Tools" to better describe the content highlighted on this page.

### Granary and Franklin logos
New logos have been added for [Granary](/identity/products#granary) and [Franklin.](/identity/products#franklin) These are libraries for which we’ve had logos for some time, but we’ve only just now gotten around to saving them out in all the correct dimensions for addition to the Branding Guide.

Learn more about Granary and Franklin at their marketing websites: 
- https://raster-foundry.github.io/granary/
- https://azavea.github.io/franklin/

Note that [logo downloads](/logo-downloads.html) and `/assets/` logos for these two libraries have been updated to match.

### Introducing: Loam and React Showtime!
We also have two other libraries that have just been added: [Loam](https://geotiffinfo.com/) and [React Showtime.](https://react-showtime.dev/) React Showtime has its own logo, but Loam does not.

## Email signature updates
We have also made several adjustments to our instructions regarding [email signatures.](/communication/email-signature.html) This includes an update to what is included in an Azavean email signature: **pronoun declarations** and **name pronunciation links.** The latter is optional, but to align with the company efforts to improve inclusity it would be great for Azaveans to update their email signatures to include the pronoun declarations.

### New email signature structure
> **First Name Last Name, Title**<br>
Pronouns: they/them/theirs | <a href="#0">click for name pronunciation</a><br>
Azavea | 990 Spring Garden Street, 5th Floor, Philadelphia, PA<br>
<a href="#0">youremail@azavea.com</a> | Phone Number<br>
<a href="#0">Website</a> | <a href="#0">Blog</a> | <a href="#0">GitHub</a> | <a href="#0">Twitter</a>

### Name pronunciation
For including information about how to pronounce your name (including a recording of you saying it!) you can use the [NameDrop](https://namedrop.io/) tool. You'll just need to sign up to use it, and then you can follow the instructions they provide to create your recording and add written descriptions for how to pronounce your name. 

### New step-by-step instructions
Finally, we updated the instructions for adding an email signature [here.](/communication/email-signature.html#steps) Unfortunately, Gmail gets funky with copy/pasting in links, it appears (thank you, Niki for noticing this!) As a result, there are considerably more detailed instructions included for how to strip styles and manually add in links.
