## Logo downloads improvements
The logo downloads are one of the most common ways in which people use the Branding Guide. In this update, a new top-level page called [Logo downloads](/logo-downloads.html) has been added. This is a no-frills page that includes logo downloads for the company, associated fellowships, and branded products and long-running open source projects.

## Clarifying changes
The separation between "Products" and "Open Source" projects was more confusing than helpful, and some Azavea projects were incorrectly located (for example, Climate API was incorrectly located on the Open Source page). Brand information for the two pages has been consolidated for simplicity.

The Logo page has also been renamed to ["Logo Guidelines"](/design/logo-guidelines.html) for additional clarity due to the above changes.
