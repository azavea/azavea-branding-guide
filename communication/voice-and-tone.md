When writing on behalf of Azavea, whether on our website or in a blog post, we strive to always be friendly, professional, and humble.

## Authentic voice

- Be friendly and kind.
- Be professional and helpful.
- Be excited and curious.
- Be respectful and humble.

## Be Polite

- Don't speak poorly of another company or person.
- Avoid comments, judgments, or opinions about religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, languages, and so on.
- Don't brag about how great your/Azavea's work is - we like to come to the table with some humility.
- Don't communicate in all caps.
