## Potential topics

- Great articles on geospatial technology, social change, civic impact, etc.
- News on our clients, partners, or community members
- Project/Product releases, launches, feature updates, etc.
- Upcoming event or conference participation
- Company news like accomplishments, volunteering and service, office events, etc.
- Things we learn at conferences and presentations (tweet from events)

## Twitter
Our goal is to create or engage in conversation related to our work. The 280 character limit enables us share small snippets of material that can be shared by our audience. We can also send messaging much more frequently than with other communication methods.
