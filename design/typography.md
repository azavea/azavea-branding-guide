description: We have two primary typefaces at Azavea – Graphik Web and Libre Franklin. What typeface you should use depends on the output of your project.

---

## Libre Franklin 
For print materials such as flyers, handouts, or business cards, we use Libre Franklin. Libre Franklin is an modern version of [Franklin Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Gothic): a popular sans-serif typeface developed in 1912. It’s a [open source project](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Franklin) being led by Impallari Type, and is available for free on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin).

## Graphik Web
On [our website,](azavea.com) and for any hosted materials that represent the Azavea brand (including this guide), we use Graphik in its sans-serif variety and normal width. The typeface was originally released in 2009 and designed by Christian Schwartz to be warm and friendly in addition to rational and “elegantly plain”.

For more detailed information about the typeface, you can refer to Graphik’s page on [Commercial Type’s](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik) website.
