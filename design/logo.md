Design guidelines for the Azavea company logo and product logos vary. Refer to [Products](/identity/products.html) to see all of our product logos, though note that there are no brand guidelines for each at this time. Following the design details associated with the Azavea logo ensures brand consistency across all communications.

## Assets

### Color logo
The Azavea logo consists of two main elements: the **symbol** to the left (you may hear it referred to as “the bones”) and **wordmark.** The color Azavea logo on a light (ideally, white) background should be used whenever possible. 

If it’s not possible to use the full logo, one of the other logo variations may be used (see below). Do not alter the colors within the symbol or wordmark in any way.

{% include image-container.html
  src =  "../images/logo-donts/anatomy.svg"
  alt =  "Azavea full logo"
%}

### Backgrounds
The standard Azavea logo works best on white or very light background colors, but does not have a background color inherent to the branding. When overlaid atop non-white backgrounds, an effort should be made to provide clarity to the elements of the logo and to use solid or less busy backgrounds.

An alternate version is available that inverts the logo for enhanced contrast on very dark backgrounds. As with the standard logo, do not alter the colors in the symbol.

{% include image-container.html
  src =  "../images/logo-white.svg"
  alt =  "White Azavea full logo"
  style = "blue"
%}

### Symbol only
Whenever possible, it is best to use the full Azavea logo with symbol and wordmark. Using the symbol alone should primarily be reserved for cases in which the full logo does not work due to size or format restrictions, such as social media avatars.

<div class="c-mark-container" markdown="1">
  {% include image-container.html
    src =  "../images/azavea-logo-bones.svg"
    alt =  "Azavea symbol shown alone, in full color"
  %}

  {% include image-container.html
    src =  "../images/azavea-logo-bones-white.svg"
    alt =  "Azavea symbol shown alone on a dark background, in white"
    style = "blue"
  %}
</div>

## Logo Usage

### Minimum Size
The Azavea logo should not be rendered at a size smaller than **16mm wide at 300dpi,** or **60px** for screen displays.

<div class="c-image-container">
  <div class="c-image c-logo--smallest">
    <img src="../images/logo-donts/smallest.svg"
         alt="The Azavea full logo shown at the smallest size the logo should be shown">
  </div>
</div>

### Minimum clearance
Always keep a clear space around the Azavea logo. The minimum required distance around the perimeter of a rectangle enclosing the Azavea logo is equal to the height of one of the symbol’s “bones”.

{% include image-container.html
  src =  "../images/logo-donts/space.svg"
  alt =  "A display of the distance between the Azavea logo and any surrounding elements with the height of a “bone”"
  style = "blue"
%}

### Logo don’ts
Neither the Azavea logo nor any of its parts may be augmented or altered in any way apart from resizing. When resizing, take care to constrain proportions and resize the entire logo.
