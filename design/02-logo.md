Design guidelines for the Azavea company logo and product logos vary. Refer to [Products](/identity/products.html) to see all of our product logos. Following the design details associated with each logo ensures brand consistency across all communications.

## Assets

### Full color
The Azavea logo consists of two main elements: the icon to the left (internally referred to as the “bones”) and complete wordmark “Azavea”. The color Azavea logo with transparent background is the standard logo option. If it’s not possible to use the standard logo option, one of the other logo variations should be applied (see below).

{% include image-container.html
  src =  "../images/logo-donts/anatomy.svg"
  alt =  "Azavea full logo"
%}

### Background colors
The Azavea color logo should be used whenever possible. However, it may be necessary to use the white logo on a background color in some cases. 

The Azavea logo works best on a white or very light background colors, but does not have a background inherent to the branding. When overlaid atop non-white backgrounds, an effort should be made to provide clarity to the elements of the logo and to overlay atop solid blocks of color. An alternate version is available that inverts the ‘azavea’ type for enhanced contrast on very dark backgrounds. Do not alter the triple-node mark.

{% include image-container.html
  src =  "../images/logo-white.svg"
  alt =  "White Azavea full logo"
  style = "blue"
%}

### Mark
Use the full Azavea logo with wordmark in all cases possible. The triple node mark should be primarily used in social media instances where the full logo does ot work due to size/format restrictions.

<div class="c-mark-container" markdown="1">
  {% include image-container.html
    src =  "../images/azavea-logo-bones.svg"
    alt =  "Azavea triple node mark shown alone, in full color"
  %}

  {% include image-container.html
    src =  "../images/azavea-logo-bones-white.svg"
    alt =  "Azavea triple node mark shown alone on a dark background, in white"
    style = "blue"
  %}
</div>

## Logo Usage

### Minimum Size
The Azavea Logo should not be rendered at a size smaller than 16mm wide at 300dpi when resized proportionally, or 60px for screen display.

<div class="c-image-container">
  <div class="c-image c-logo--smallest">
    <img src="../images/logo-donts/smallest.svg" 
         alt="The Azavea full logo shown at the smallest size the logo should be shown">
  </div>
</div>

### Minimum clearance
Always keep a clear space around the Azavea Logo. The minimum required distance around the perimeter of a rectangle enclosing the Azavea logo is equal to the height of one of the icon&rsquo;s &ldquo;bones&rdquo;.

{% include image-container.html
  src =  "../images/logo-donts/space.svg"
  alt =  "A display of the distance between the Azavea logo and any surrounding elements with the height of a bone"
  style = "blue"
%}

### Logo don’ts
Neither the Azavea logo nor any of its parts may be augmented or altered in any way apart from resizing. When resizing, take care to constrain proportions and resize the entire logo.
