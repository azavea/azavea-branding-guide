## Color Usage

### Primary Palette
The three main colors that make up Azavea's logo are the basis of color use in our website and print materials.

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "card"
  name = "Light blue"
  hex = "4ba6dd"
  rgb = "75, 166, 221"
  cmyk = "66, 25, 0, 13"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "card"
  name = "Medium blue"
  hex = "3773a1"
  rgb = "55, 115, 161"
  cmyk = "66, 29, 0, 37"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "card"
  name = "Dark blue"
  hex = "204f72"
  rgb = "32, 79, 114"
  cmyk = "72, 31, 0, 55"
%}

### Supporting colors
Colors from our secondary palette should be used sparingly. They are for categorical differentiation (e.g. in the blog) or as a contrasting color to the Azavean blues.

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Company"
  hex = "0e4266"

  cmyk = "86, 35, 0, 60"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Spatial analysis"

  rgb = "83, 174, 82"
  cmyk = "52, 0, 53, 32"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Events"

%}
