description: Azavea's color scheme helps emote our company's personality. We do not typically align the branding colors with our applications, but do try to use color meaningfully in our work. The below colors will only cover color as it relates to Azavea's brand.

As a company, Azavea is committed to complying with [WGAC 2.0 AA contrast ratios.](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) Refer to the [Resources](/resources.html) page for helpful tools.

## Color Usage

### Primary Palette
The three main colors that make up Azavea's logo are the basis of color use in our website and print materials.

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "card"
  name = "Sky"
  hex =  "4ba6dd"
  rgb =  "75, 166, 221"
  cmyk = "66, 25, 0, 13"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "card"
  name = "Denim"
  hex =  "3773a1"
  rgb =  "55, 115, 161"
  cmyk = "66, 29, 0, 37"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "card"
  name = "Midnight"
  hex =  "204f72"
  rgb =  "32, 79, 114"
  cmyk = "72, 31, 0, 55"
%}

### Supporting colors
Colors from our secondary palette should be used sparingly. They are for categorical differentiation (e.g. in the blog) or as a contrasting color to the Azavean blues.

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Sapphire"
  hex =  "0e4266"
  rgb =  "14, 66, 102"
  cmyk = "86, 35, 0, 60"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Light forest"
  hex =  "53ae52"
  rgb =  "83, 174, 82"
  cmyk = "52, 0, 53, 32"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Medium orchid"
  hex =  "d45db0"
  rgb =  "212, 93, 176"
  cmyk = "0, 56, 17, 17"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Medium gold"
  hex =  "f1b210"
  rgb =  "241, 178, 16"
  cmyk = "0, 26, 93, 5"
%}

### Neutral colors
Our grayscale is based upon the Azavea <strong>Midnight</strong> color. These colors all have a blueish tint as a result.

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Ink"
  hex =  "27323D"
  rgb =  "39, 50, 61"
  cmyk = "36, 18, 0, 76"
%}

{% include color-patch.html
  type = "row"
  name = "Granite"
