## Color Usage

### Primary Palette
The three main colors that make up Azavea's logo are the basis of color use in our website and print materials.

### Supporting colors
Colors from our secondary palette should be used sparingly. They are for categorical differentiation (e.g. in the blog) or as a contrasting color to the Azavean blues.

### Grayscale
Our grayscale is based upon the Azavean tertiary color. All grays have a blue tint. Use these grays in print and web whereever possible.
