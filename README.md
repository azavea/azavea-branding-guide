# Azavea’s Design System
A design system for Azavea that contains visual assets (logos, color palettes, logo do’s and don’ts, etc) and guiding principles (blog writing tips, accessibility tools, resources, etc).

## How it works
Azavea’s design system is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, and [Style Guide Guide](https://github.com/bradfrost/style-guide-guide), a style guide boilerplate. The SCSS follows rules set in Brad Frost's article [CSS Architecture for Design Systems.](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/css-architecture-for-design-systems/)

## Getting Started
1. Download or clone the files from the [repository on Github](https://github.com/azavea/azavea-design-system).
2. In the command line, navigate to the root of the project and run 
```jekyll serve```
3. This will build and serve the app on port `4000` in your browser.
