Azavea develops and maintains several open source tools and libraries as long-term projects. These projects are treated as pseudo-products and have their own branding guidelines and resources.


## GeoTrellis
“GeoTrellis” should always be written in upper camel case. View [GeoTrellis’ website](https://geotrellis.io/) for more information about the library.

{% include image-container.html
  src =  "../images/logo-geotrellis.png"
  alt =  "GeoTrellis"
%}

  style = "inverted"
%}

### Elevator pitch
> Plan for the future with reliable data. Our Lab interface lets you experiment with different models and scenarios for universally-recognized temperature and precipitation indicators. Access the same data for your research and application development through our API.

### Tagline
